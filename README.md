## Brainflix

Brainflix is a fully responsive full-stack web application that mimics YouTube. This was one of the first React apps that I created while attending the Brainstation Software Engineering bootcamp. Some of the features include being able to select what video you would like to watch, commenting on each video and uploading a video. Initially the project was built using Express and node for the backend but I decided to go back and build a database using MySQL ,Knex, express and node.
